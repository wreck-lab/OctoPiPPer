# printHAT
The printHAT is an add-on card designed to transform your Raspberry Pi computer into a powerful 3D printer control board. It uses [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) software to deliver the best performance in class, and the [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) web interface to provide the end user with the easiest experience ever.  
To buy or learn more about the board check out the printHAT site. If you already got one have a look at the [installation manual](https://phat.wrecklab.com/manual/), download the [configuration files](config) for your printer and print one of the [featured enclosures](step/enclosures).
